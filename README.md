## What is this
This is my learning repository and experimental implementations for the frontend framework Lit. Due to lack of performance testing, these implementations will always remain in this repository for reference only. If you are interested in turning any of these ideas into an npm package, please inform me via issues - I would be happy to see my ideas implemented.

## Project Overview
**lit-fn-demo**
This project demonstrates how to use lit-fn to write React-like functional components in Lit.

**lit-fn-easy**
This project demonstrates how to use alien-signals to simply implement a functional component and its reactive handling.

**lit-fn-solid**
This project demonstrates how to convert Lit components into Solid components.

**lit-with-signal**
This project demonstrates how to use @lit-labs/signals and @xignal/lit to implement reactive handling, analyzing the advantages and limitations of both approaches.

**lit-with-proxy**
This project demonstrates how to use Object.defineProperty to implement DOM reactive proxying, implementing a functional component writing style inspired by the Elm architecture.

**lit-elm**
Implements a functional component writing style based on alien-signals following the Elm architecture.
